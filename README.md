# Cinema-Compass
Project 3 for Data Structures and Algorithms (COP3530).
Created by Patrick Iteghie, Quintin Lopez-Scarim, and Caleigh Zaguirre.

This program is built to find the actor you are searching for within the IMDB database and return movies that that actor has starred in. 
The program also recommends other movies based on the movies that the actor has starred in, so you never run out of movies to watch!

This program utilizes Python's Numpy and Pandas libraries to compare the data within the IMDB database through Breadth-First-Search and Depth-First-Search techniques.
The program also uses Pyvis to visualize the compared data as a readable graph.
