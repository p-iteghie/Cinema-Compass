# Cinema-Compass
Project 3 for Data Structures and Algorithms (COP3530).
Created by Patrick Iteghie, Quintin Lopez-Scarim, and Caleigh Zaguirre.

This program is built to find the actor you are searching for within an IMDb dataset and return the actor's coworkers as an undirected graph based on common movies. Additionally, this program compares finding that actor with a Breadth-First-Search vs Depth-First-Search, starting from the dataset's first person.

The program acts as a way to show off other actors based on some movies that the chosen actor has starred in so you never run out of actors to check out!

This program utilizes Python's Numpy & Pandas libraries to manipulate the data within the IMDb dataset, Cinemagoer to access the IMDb website for more information, Pyvis & NetworkX to display the data as an interactive graph, and Streamlit to deploy the code as a web app.
